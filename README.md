# ZMK-config for the Lechuza keyboard

The [Lechuza](https://github.com/elagil/lechuza) is a keyboard that is based on the STM32L072 processor. This repository includes all necessary configuration files, for building ZMK for that board.
Use this repository as a basis for your implementing your own keymap.

Simply fork it, and edit the [keymap file](config/lechuza.keymap) in the `config` folder. After pushing, the firmware will be created as a build artifact by the GitHub pipeline.
